            <h3>Hi, I'm Channie</h3>
            <p>I enjoy doing photography as a hobby in my spare time! </p>
            <p>Taking photos has always been a passion of mine, When I was a teenager my parents bought me a digital camera - I took it everywhere with me, always taking photos. </p>
            <p>Photos bring me joy because they are like a memory captured in time, there is nothing better then looking back at photos and remembering how amazing that day was; the little details that come pouring in your mind just from a look back on a photo!  </p>
            <p>This website was created to show some of the work that I have done over the years</p>
            <p>I am a small town girl who grew up on Vancouver Island, I was born and raised in Courtenay, BC and I currently reside in Campbell River, BC</p>
            <p>Feel free to take a look at my work and contact me if you would like to take a chance and see if I can help with your photography needs!</p>
